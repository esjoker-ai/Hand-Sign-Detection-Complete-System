# Hand-Sign-Detection-Complete-System
The application uses a custom-trained YOLO model (model.pt) to detect and classify several hand signs, including "hello," "ok," "no," "ilv," and "thank you." The system includes user authentication with a login and signup page, and a video stream that displays the detected hand gestures in real-time.
